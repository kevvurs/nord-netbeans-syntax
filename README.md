# Nord Theme for NetBeans
Editor presets for NetBeans, following the [Nord Theme][nord] color palette.

## Installation
Download the __netbeans-nord-theme.zip__ file. Open NetBeans and load the presets by going to
Tools > Options (or NetBeans > Preferences in macOS) and selecting Import. Then
select the .zip file to import it.

## Status
Tested with NetBeans 11 on Linux and macOS. I added the color presets for the
editor only. The package has settings for general syntax rules and Java. Comparing
to other ports of the themes, I would say this is currently 80% accurate for .java
files, but other syntax presets are lacking. Work is in progress to sync up as many
styles as possible. Comparisons largely based on [Atom's official Nord theme][atom].
